1. Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building. 
   What are the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the language you picked? You can search for the answers by google.

  I chose Python

  Linting
    PyFlakes
    Pycodestyle
    Mccabe

  Testing
    Robot
    PyTest
    Unittest
    DocTest
    Nose2
    Testify

  Building
    Not needed


2. What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions? Again, you can ask google!
  CircleCI
  TeamCity
  Bamboo
  GitLab
  so on....

3. I'd say cloud-based. Python projects are usually small in size.
